# TDAkit
Collection of tools for Topological Data Analysis:
- [**Mapper**](https://github.com/romiebanerjee/TDAkit/tree/master/mapper): Simple implementation fo mapper algorithm (point-cloud to 1d-simplicial complex)
- [**k-nerve**](https://github.com/romiebanerjee/TDAkit/tree/master/k-nerve): Generlization of mapper to higher dimensions (point-cloud to k dimensional simplicial complex)
- [**simplicial-set**](https://github.com/romiebanerjee/TDAkit/tree/master/simplicial-sets): Python class for realizing simplicial stes (superset of simplcial complexes capable of modelling the homotopy category of spaces)
